# Canids-ExternalLM
This R code is built to replicate the GM analyses of Hebdon et al. (in prep).

To modify this code for your own study you will need to replace/change the following:
1. to update the landmarks include in the analysis you will need to add/replace the landmark files in the "LMs" folder and run a new GPA analysis in SlicerMorph replacing the contents of the Data folder with the output of that analysis.
2. A classifier sheet updated for all included animals and a column representing the classification schemes of interest. Further modification of the code is required to accomodate new classifciation schemes
